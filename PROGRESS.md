# 100 Days of DevOps — Progress

Use this checklist to track daily entries. Each item should link to the corresponding file in `days/`.

**How I update this file**
- After finishing a day’s note, tick the box and keep the short title accurate.
- Keep a steady pace: target **≥5 entries/week**.
- Redact secrets in linked files using `<PLACEHOLDER>`.
